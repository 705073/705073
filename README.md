Tracking Daily Temperatures to Identify Heatwave Days
You are helping an environmental agency monitor temperatures to identify "heatwave days." A heatwave day is defined as any day where the temperature is above 35°C. Your job is to write a program that:
1. Analyzes a list of daily temperatures for one month (e.g., 30 days).
2. Uses a for loop and an if statement to check if each day's temperature is above 35°C.
3. Counts the number of heatwave days and prints this count.
4. Prints the temperatures for each heatwave day.
